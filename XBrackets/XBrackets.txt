* XBrackets Lite for Notepad++ 8.x.x (and above)
* by DV, Jan 2009 - Jul 2025
***********************************************

XBrackets Lite allows to autocomplete brackets ([{""}]) i.e. it inserts
corresponding right bracket when the left bracket is typed.
The plugin uses "smart" autocompletion:
- next character is analysed for ([{ brackets;
- next & previous characters are analysed for " quote.

This plugin is a Notepad++'es port of my XBrackets plugin for AkelPad. 
As Scintilla highlights pair brackets by itself, XBrackets Lite doesn't 
do this (unlike XBrackets for AkelPad) - therefore I call it "XBrackets Lite".

Special manual options inside the file "XBrackets.ini":

1. "FileExtsRule" allows to specify file extensions which will be supported or
ignored by XBrackets.
Examples:
  ; tells XBrackets to support ANY file (by default)
  FileExtsRule=
  ; the same
  FileExtsRule=+
  ; the same
  FileExtsRule=-
  
  ; tells XBrackets to support ONLY .txt .ini .htm .html .xml files
  FileExtsRule=+txt ini htm html xml
  
  ; tells XBrackets to support ANY file EXCEPT .c .cpp .cxx .h .hpp .hxx
  FileExtsRule=-c cpp cxx h hpp hxx

2. "Sel_AutoBr" allows to specify what to do with the selected text when a
left (opening) bracket has been typed.
The following values are supported:
  Sel_AutoBr=0
    When left (opening) bracket is typed, the selected text is disappeared
    (replaced with the bracket).
    Examples:
      |abc| + {  results in  {
  Sel_AutoBr=1
    When left (opening) bracket is typed, the selected text is enclosed with
    the corresponding brackets pair.
    Examples:
      |abc| + {  results in  {|abc|}
  Sel_AutoBr=2
    When left (opening) bracket is typed, the selected text is enclosed with
    the corresponding brackets pair, and the brackets pair become selected
    also. If the selected text already starts and ends with the corresponding
    brackets pair, the brackets will be removed.
    Examples:
      |abc| + {    results in  |{abc}|
      |{abc}| + {  results in  |abc|
  Sel_AutoBr=3
    When left (opening) bracket is typed, the selected text is enclosed with
    the corresponding brackets pair, and the brackets pair is _not_ selected
    also. If the selected text already starts and ends with the corresponding
    brackets pair, the brackets will be removed. If the surrounding brackets
    are not selected, they are not removed. (This mode was inspired by the
    Sublime Text editor.)
    Examples:
      |abc| + {    results in  {|abc|}
      |{abc}| + {  results in  |abc|
      {|abc|} + {  results in  {{|abc|}}
  Sel_AutoBr=4
    When left (opening) bracket is typed, the selected text is enclosed with
    the corresponding brackets pair, and the brackets pair is _not_ selected
    also. If the selected text already starts and ends with the corresponding
    brackets pair, the brackets will be removed. If the surrounding brackets
    are not selected, they are also removed. Thus, type a left bracket/quote
    to enclose the selected text with the corresponding brackets pair, and
    type the left bracket/quote again to remove the enclosing brackets/quotes.
    (This mode was inspired by the Sublime Text editor.)
    Examples:
      |abc| + {    results in  {|abc|}
      |{abc}| + {  results in  |abc|
      {|abc|} + {  results in  |abc|

3. "Next_Char_OK" defines a set of characters which are OK for brackets
auto-completion when you type an opening bracket _before_ a character from
this set.
Also, brackets are auto-completed before the supported right brackets from
the following set: )]}>"' .
Additionally, brackets are auto-completed before the following white-space
characters: '\0', '\r', '\n', ' ' and '\t'.
Example:
  Next_Char_OK=.,!?:;</

4. "Prev_Char_OK" defines a set of characters which are OK for brackets
auto-completion when you type a bracket _after_ such character.
This rule is applied only to those bracket pairs which have identical opening
and closing characters (such as "" and '').
Additionally, such brackets are auto-completed after the following white-space
characters: '\0', '\r', '\n', ' ' and '\t'.
Example:
  Prev_Char_OK=([{<=

# npp-XBracketsLite

XBrackets Lite for Notepad++ allows to autocomplete brackets ([{""}]) i.e. it inserts the corresponding right bracket when a left bracket is typed.
The plugin uses "smart" brackets autocompletion:
- next character is analysed for ([{ brackets;
- next & previous characters are analysed for " and ' quotes.

The manual option `Sel_AutoBr` allows to enclose (or disclose) the selected text with brackets.  
See "XBrackets.txt" for details.
